## 📖 Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end Business Intelligence analysis based on 540,000+ rows of transactional data from a UK-based cross-border e-commerce platform. 

Objective: To identify growth drivers, optimize inventory management, and refine marketing strategies for the upcoming fiscal year by analyzing sales trends, market distribution, and product diversity.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### 1. Data ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
- Tool: Microsoft Excel (Power Query)
- Process:
  - Cleaned 540k rows of raw data, handling null values in CustomerID.
  - Logic Validation: Excluded records with Quantity < 0 (Returns) to ensure revenue accuracy.

### 2. Data Modeling
- Tool: Power BI (DAX)
- Key Metrics: Built data models for Average Order Value (AOV), Order Volume, and MoM Growth Rates.

## 🚀 Key Insights & Visualizations

### 1. Seasonal Trends & "Peak Season" Signal
- Observation: Sales spiked from 644k in August to 907k in September, recording a 40.8% MoM growth. This signals the start of the Q4 peak season.
- Peak: The annual revenue peaked in November (1.15M), aligning with Black Friday and Christmas pre-sales.

### 2. Market Distribution Strategy
- Core Insight: Excluding the UK, Netherlands emerged as the #1 overseas market (~300k revenue), likely driven by B2B wholesale logistics.
- Opportunity: EIRE (Ireland) shows the highest retention potential, while Germany and France remain the volume leaders.

### 3. The "Long-tail" Effect
- Data Finding: The Top 10 best-selling SKUs contribute only 1% of total volume.
- Conclusion: The business is driven by a vast variety of niche products rather than a few "blockbusters".
